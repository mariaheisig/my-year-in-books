# Reading review
This is a Power BI dashboard that dives into my reading stats for a year. The dashboard has 3 parts: <br>

- an overview of all books read in 2021
- a deep dive into genres
- a closer look at monthly stats.<br>

You can check out the sample of the data to see what kind of data I had available. 


## Overview of 2021
The first dashboard look at 2021 as a whole.

## Genre deep dive
For the second dashboard I decided to dive deeper into the genres to see how my preferences and ratings of each genres varied month-over-month.<br>

This dashboard is interactive, so I advice to download the PowerBI file to get the full value out of it.

## Monthly stats
The last dashboard looks at month-over-month stats:
- number of books read
- avg pages read
- avg rating
- avg time to finish a book

All four graphs also include a yearly average to better illustrate how each metric varies througout the year.
